= hello -- a sample ruby project

This package contains a hello project which is meant to provide
suggestions concerning how to structure and package ruby projects.

* How to structure[link:files/doc/files_and_directories_rdoc.html]
  project directories, which auxilliary files to
  include in a distribution (README, CHANGELOG, etc)
* providing source code documentation[link:files/doc/rdoc_rdoc.html] 
  using +rdoc+ approriate unit test
* {Automating tasks}[link:files/doc/rake_rdoc.html] using +rake+
* {Functional testing}[link:files/doc/functional_testing_rdoc.html] 
  using +Test+::+Unit+ build support using +rake+
* {Packaging and distributing}[link:files/doc/rubygems_rdoc.html] your project using +rubygems+.
* {Configuration}[link:files/doc/config_rdoc.html] and resource files.
* Internationalizing[link:files/doc/i18n_rdoc.html] your application or library.
* Providing (and parsing) proper {command line options}[link:files/doc/commandline_rdoc.html]
* Handling {plattform specific}[link:files/doc/plattform_rdoc.html] issues.
* {Distributing and promoting}[link:files/doc/dist_rdoc.html] your project.

None of the suggestions here are set in stone, so feel free to do things
diffrently if you feel it makes more sense. (I prefer to indent using
tabs not spaces, which is the 'norm' in ruby). Consider this project to
be a template that might help you through the tedium of setting up a
project infrastructure to help you get coding real stuff quicker.

== Installing

Having a "Installing" section is a bit of a chicken or egg question.
Someone reading the README has, in all likelyhood already installed your
package. On the other hand, in case your project has a more involved
build process, it might be worthwhile to consider describing it in a
seperate INSTALL file.

It can't hurt to provide canonical instructions for installation,
though. You can install the +hello+ package by executing:

	gem install hello -r

alternatively, you can download +.tar.gz+ or +.zip+ archives from 
Rubyforge[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2203].


== Mailing List

In case you discover bugs, spelling errors, offer suggestions for
improvements or would like to help out with the project, you can contact
me directly (tim@kuriositaet.de) or through the mailing list
(hello-talk@rubyforge.org).
